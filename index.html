                    <p class="myteamsection">This is the team that I have worked alongside with to help accomplish my finished web design project.
                        We have collaborated together to help each other to complete our assignment, and through this website you shall see how this was achieved.
                        We are a group of friends that have stayed together since the beginning of the academic year, and have been extremely helpful with each other on all 
                        modules that we are all on. Hopefully you the reader will appreciate what I have developed with the skills that I have gained from the lessons / practicals that myself has attended.
                        Furthermore you shall also see the extra knowledge that i have gained from reading other material, and implementing this within my site.
                    </p>
                    <p class="myteamsection">To the right hand side of the website you will be able to see each team member. Clicking on their name you shall see each individual biography.
                        Under their name you will see a small picture version from their main biography page, giving a clear vision of each member from within our group.</p>

                        <!-- This is a video that i created myself, has not been taken from a website -->
                    <p class="myteamsection">A team video, showing each member of the team on where they gathered their inspiration from, by showing the sites that they wanted to emulate.
                        Taking turns each member shows and describes what sites inspired them and why. Furthermore the video will also cover the basic requiremnts that our website needs,
                        to be able to achieve the desired requiremnts for this module.
