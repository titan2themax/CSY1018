                <p class="specialtext">What is network security and what do they do? well Network Security Analysts design, implement and also maintain computer and information security systems.
                     They manage networks to detect any suspicious or hostile activities, and take measures, like installing firewalls, to help defend against malicious attacks on computer systems. 
                     Network Security Analyst normally work as part of a large team.
                     Demand for Network Security Analysts is very high.
