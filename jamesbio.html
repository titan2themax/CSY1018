                    <h1 id="mainheader">James's Biography</h1>
                    <p class="myteamsection">My name is James Sharman, I am a mature student that is attending Northampton University and studying a degree in computers. Since the age of 18 my desire for knowledge in computers has expanded to the present day where I now feel I would like a career in computing. 
                        I currently reside in Oxfordshire in a small town called Bicester, where I commute to attend University. In three years when I have my degree I would like to specialise in the field of network security, and possibly look to have a job around or near the Milton Keynes area, there are many jobs that fit the description of my desired career. 
                        My main hobbies are attending the gym, where I like to stay as fit as possible. I like to visit historical locations such as castles, manor houses and gardens. I also like in my spare time to socialise with friends and family, where I either go for drinks or meals at different restaurants in the local area. For extra work I like to fix computers either for family or friends when their computers break or need a swift upgrade, also helping my brother in law at his place of work in a funeral home, where I feel I earn plenty of life experiences that help me become the person I am today.
